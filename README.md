Part of my work for an exam at the Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt on verifiable secret sharing.

This repository contains the implementation of Pedersen, Feldman and ABCD verifiable secret sharing.
They work locally and use cyclic abelian groups.

The code for the abelian groups was taken from https://github.com/ojroques/garbled-circuit that contain a different type of multy-party computation algorithm.
